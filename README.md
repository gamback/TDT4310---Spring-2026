## `TDT4310 - Intelligent Text Analytics and Language Understanding - 2026`

Throughout this course, we will explore many aspects of natural language processing, starting with the very latest developments within language models - specifically *large* language models. From there on, we go back to learn more fundamental topics such as part-of-speech tagging, grammars, dependency parsing and tasks like sentiment analysis and topic modeling.

All labs will be provided as Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb). The first lab will only consist of questions-answers in markdown-cells, to get familiar with the format. The remaining labs will require you to properly use the environment with a mix of markdown and code cells.

**The labs are not obligatory this year but it’s strongly recommended that you work with them to understand the basic techniques and as a preparation for the course project.**

### `🔧 Lab setup`

Each lab will have files starting with the prefix `lab{N}`, ${N} \in \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$. Each lab will have at least two files:

- `lab{N}_description.md` - a description of the lab
- `lab{N}_exercises.ipynb` - the main notebook with the exercises
  - **you may submit this file to blackboard**

### `📝 Delivery`

If you want, you may submit your `lab{N}_exercises_{your-username}.ipynb` file to Blackboard. You can submit as many times as you want. The listed “deadline” below is a recommendation for when each exercise should be completed in order to keep up with the tempo of the course.
